By automating the skill matching between job vacancies and candidates, the job matching system powered by machine learning revolutionises the hiring process. The system thoroughly examines job descriptions using natural language processing techniques, taking into account both keywords and term context.

Dataset is made available as rar file and can be used for training the model.
Keep all these files in same path and first run data_processing.py for creating and training the model.
